          <p>
            Hello everyone, I am Ting and I am taking the last few classes of my master's program in CS. 
                I took classes from differenct areas during the program, including data science and software development. 
                I want to learn useful skills in this course as I don't have relatival experience. Taking about 
                the class group chat, I think either is fine.</p>

      <p>I'd like to go outside. Chicago is perfect in the summer. It's so 
        beautiful where is full of sunshine and green. I'd love to hiking.
